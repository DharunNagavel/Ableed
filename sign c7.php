<h2>Common Fruits and Vegetables</h2>
<li>Fruits and vegetables are an important part of daily meals.</li><br><li> Some common fruit signs include "apple," which is signed by twisting the knuckle of your index finger on your cheek, and "banana," which is signed by mimicking peeling a banana.</li><br><li> Vegetables like "carrot" are signed by making a fist and moving it toward the mouth as if biting a carrot, while "corn" is shown by moving an index finger from one side of the mouth to the other, as if eating corn on the cob.</li><br>

<h2>Meals and Drinks</h2>
<li>Meals include breakfast, lunch, and dinner.</li><br><li> The sign for "breakfast" combines the sign for "eat" with "morning," while "lunch" combines "eat" with "afternoon," and "dinner" uses "eat" with "night."</li><br><li> Common drinks include "water," signed by tapping a "W" handshape on the chin, and "juice," made by forming a "J" shape near the mouth.</li><br>

<h2>Expressing Food Preferences</h2>
<li>To talk about food preferences, use simple phrases.</li><br><li> For example, "I like apples" is signed by pointing to yourself, signing "like" (pulling the thumb and middle finger away from the chest), and signing "apple."</li><br><li> To say, "I don’t eat meat," sign "I," "don’t" (shaking the head while signing "not" with a thumb under the chin), and "eat meat" (the sign for "eat" followed by the sign for "meat," which involves pinching the flesh of your hand).</li><br>

<h2>Practicing Conversations About Food</h2>
<li>To improve fluency, practice signing about your favorite foods and drinks.</li><br><li> Try signing full sentences like, "I drink coffee in the morning" or "I don’t like spicy food."</li><br><li> Engaging in conversations about meals helps build confidence in everyday communication.</li><br>
