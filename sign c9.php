    <h1>Common Signs for Emotions</h1>
<li>Emotions are an important part of communication in sign language.</li><br><li> Some common emotion signs include "happy," which is signed by patting the chest with both hands in an upward motion, and "sad," which is shown by dragging open hands down the face.</li><br><li> "Angry" is signed by making a claw shape with one hand and moving it upward from the chest, while "excited" is signed by alternating circular motions with open hands on the chest.</li><br>

<h1>Expressing Feelings in Different Situations</h1>
<li>In sign language, expressing emotions goes beyond just using signsâ€”it also includes facial expressions and body language.</li><br><li> For example, if you are signing "scared," widen your eyes and move your hands quickly toward your body to show fear.</li><br><li> If you are signing "tired," droop your shoulders and move both hands down from the chest to show exhaustion.</li><br><li> Using the right expression makes the message clear and natural.</li><br>

<h1>Talking About Your Emotions</h1>
<li>To communicate feelings effectively, practice signing full sentences.</li><br><li> For example, "I am happy today" is signed by pointing to yourself, signing "happy," and then signing "today" (moving both hands down in front of you).</li><br><li> If you want to say, "I feel tired after work," sign "I," "feel" (using an open hand moving upward on the chest), "tired," and "work."</li><br><li> This helps express emotions in daily conversations.</li><br>

<h1>Practicing Emotional Charades</h1>
<li>A great way to improve signing emotions is by playing emotional charades.</li><br><li> One person signs an emotion without speaking, and others guess which feeling it represents.</li><br><li> This game helps build confidence, improves recognition of signs, and strengthens the use of facial expressions in sign language communication.</li><br>
